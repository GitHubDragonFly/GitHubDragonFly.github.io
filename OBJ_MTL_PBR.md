# OBJ Material Entries (MTL file)

Keep in mind that this repository is using the following customized OBJ related three.js files: `OBJ Loader`, `MTL Loader` and `OBJ Exporter`.

These files have been synchronized to work with each other and process all custom PBR entries found in the MTL file, as listed further below, aiming at providing the GLTF alike functionality in the OBJ Viewer by taking advantage of the `THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial` and a modified `GLTF Loader`.

All the entries have been set as such so they are compatible with `three.js` as well as the `assimp` library being used in this repository:
- Note that the `assimp` library was heavily customized with features currently not available in the official repository but available in the [updates](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/assimp/tree/updates) branch

Most, if not all, of the available viewers do include the OBJ Exporter, thus can try to export their models to `OBJ + MTL + textures` format with whatever limitations there might be (like animations for example).

As for the textures, any of the following image formats should work with OBJ models when specified in the MTL file:
  - BMP, DDS, GIF, JPEG, KTX2, PNG, TGA, WEBP:
    - DDS, KTX2 and TGA textures will be converted to PNG format
  - Test model can be found [here](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/GitHubDragonFly.github.io/tree/main/viewers/examples/cerberus) and each of the zip files can be loaded as such:
    - clicking each of these zip files will take you to the page where you should look for 3 dots button in the top right corner and its option to copy permalink of the file to the clipboard which can then be pasted into the `URL` textbox of my [OBJ Viewer](https://githubdragonfly.github.io/viewers/templates/OBJ%20Viewer.html)
    - the other option would be to just download the file to a hard drive and load it with the `Browse` option of the OBJ Viewer

This document would represent a summary of PBR entries that can be found in the exported MTL file, with mentioning of some possibly utilized standard entries, whose description can be seen online [here](https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/), as well as just a few FYI Blender adopted entries as per [these proposals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file#Physically-based_rendering).

Since the MTL file is a text file, then it could be edited manually and any entries changed if required.

## Standard Entries:

 - Ka, Kd, Ke, Ks, Ns, Ni, Tr, Tf, d, illum, -bm, -s, -o
 - map_Ka, map_Kd, map_Ke, map_Ks, bump, map_bump, map_d, norm, disp

## PBR Entries with associated textures (maps):

 - `a` - alphaTest (alphaCutoff)
 - `s` - material side
 - `Pe` - emissive intensity
 - `Prf` - reflectivity
 - `Pac` / `Pad` - attenuationColor / attenuationDistance

 - `Pm` - metalness
   - `map_Pm` - metalnessMap
 - `Pr` - roughness
   - `map_Pr` - roughnessMap
 - `map_Px` - replaces both `map_Pm` and `map_Pr` when they are identical

 - `Pa`/ `Par` - anisotropy / anisotropy rotation (BLENDER: `aniso` / `anisor`)
   - `map_Pa` - anisotropyMap

 - `Pi` / `Pii` - iridescence / iridescenceIOR
   - `map_Pi` - iridescenceMap
 - `Pitx` / `Pity` - iridescenceThicknessMinimum / iridescenceThicknessMaximum (aka iridescenceThicknessRange[x, y] in three.js)
   - `map_Pit` - iridescenceThicknessMap

 - `Pcc` / `Pcr` - clearcoat / clearcoat roughness (BLENDER: `Pc` / `Pcr`)
   - `map_Pcc` - clearcoatMap
   - `map_Pcn` - clearcoatNormalMap
   - `map_Pcr` - clearcoatRoughnessMap

 - `Ps` / `Psr` - sheenColor [RGB] / sheenRoughness (BLENDER: using `Ps` for sheen layer intensity instead)
   - `map_Psc` - sheenColorMap (BLENDER: `map_Ps`)
   - `map_Psr` - sheenRoughnessMap`

 - `Pth` - thickness
   - `map_Pth` - thicknessMap

 - `Ptr` - transmission
   - `map_Ptr` - transmissionMap

 - `Psp` - specularColor [RGB]
   - `map_Psp` - specularColorMap

 - `Psi` - specularIntensity
   - `map_Psi` - specularIntensityMap

Entries currently not compatible with the `assimp` library but working fine in the OBJ + MTL Viewer:

 - `-c` - texture center of rotation
 - `-r` - texture rotation value
 - `-w` - texture wrapping parameters (`wrapS` and `wrapT`)
 - `Pns` - normalScale
 - `Pcn` - clearcoatNormalScale
 - `Pdt` - depthTest
 - `Pli` - lightMapIntensity
 - `disp_b` - displacementBias
 - `disp_s` - displacementScale
 - `Pbr_ps` - sheen (layer intensity)
 - `Pbr_pl_map` - lightMap

Keep in mind that other OBJ + MTL viewers will probably NOT be able to interpret most of these PBR entries.

# Testing

This can be tested by using the [Khronos Group glTF v2.0 examples](https://github.-com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0) and following these instructions:

 - Use my [GLTF Viewer](https://githubdragonfly.github.io/viewers/templates/GLTF%20Viewer.html) to load one of those example GLTF files via the viewer's `URL` option, here is an example url:
   - `https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/blob/master/2.0/IridescenceMetallicSpheres/glTF/IridescenceMetallicSpheres.gltf`
 - Use the viewer's `OBJ` export option to get `OBJ + MTL + textures` in a zip file
 - Extract all the files to a folder on your device (this needs to be done since my viewers currently don't support loading of zip files)
 - Examine the MTL file to see what the entries look like and then do the following:
   - Use my [OBJ Viewer](https://githubdragonfly.github.io/viewers/templates/ASSIMP%20Viewer.html) or [ASSIMP Viewer](https://githubdragonfly.github.io/viewers/templates/ASSIMP%20Viewer.html) and select its `Browse` option to load these extracted files all at once - your device will have to allow loading local files
   - `OBJ Viewer` additionally supports loading of `ZIP` files
 - After the model is loaded then make sure to check the `Eq` box in the viewer to get the environment texture / lights

Most of the examples will work properly but some might NOT.
