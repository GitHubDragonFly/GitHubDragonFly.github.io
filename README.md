# GitHubDragonFly.github.io
GitHubDragonFly's Website - access it [here](https://githubdragonfly.github.io)

Initially designed to serve as a hub with links to repositories and [three.js](https://threejs.org) 3D model viewers.

Do understand that GitHub servers are providing correct access to files, so cloning or downloading this repository will not have the same functionality if run locally without some server.

Repositories do contain projects in several different programming languages or a mix of: Java, VB .Net, C#, python, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, shell.

There is a lot of information and descriptions, some intended for Industrial Automation and some for general/personal use.

Notes about three.js viewers:
 - they are functional `AS THEY ARE`
 - intended for viewing a single 3D model
 - the best choice of loading 3D models is via the viewers `URL` option
 - access to all three.js examples can be achieved with the following URL format, mind the correct path after `models`:
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/models/gltf/LittlestTokyo.glb`
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/models/collada/abb_irb52_7_120.dae`
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/models/vrml/house.wrl`
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/models/fbx/cloth.fbx`
 - lots of URL examples available in the [HTML_CSS_JS_Flask](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS_Flask) repository
 - lots of loading instructions in the [HTML_CSS_JS](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS) repository
 - some viewers might have some limitations when loading files locally from a hard drive
