# GitHubDragonFly.github.io
GitHubDragonFly's Website

Initially designed to serve as a hub with links to repositories and [three.js](https://threejs.org) 3D model viewers.

Repositories do contain projects in several different programming languages or a mix of: VB .Net, C#, python, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, shell.

There is a lot of information and descriptions, some intended for Industrial Automation and some for general/personal use.

Notes about three.js viewers:
 - they are functional `AS THEY ARE`
 - the best choice of loading 3D models is via the viewers `URL` option
 - access to all three.js examples can be achieved with the following URL format, with the correct path after `models`:
 - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/models/gltf/ferrari.glb`
 - lots of URL examples in [HTML_CSS_JS_Flask](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS_Flask) and [HTML_CSS_JS](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/HTML_CSS_JS) repositories
 - some viewers might have some limitations when loading files locally from a hard drive
