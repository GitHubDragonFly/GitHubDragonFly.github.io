The Lego Brick model was originally created as OBJ file by [JSModeler](https://github.com/kovacsv/JSModeler) and then modified and converted to other formats.

Legacy JSON examples are from r68 and r69 releases of the three.js and were modified as follows:

- Adjusted positions of the root bone - all models
- Changed `transparency` to `opacity` - `marine` `human_walk_0_female` models

Some additional legacy models can also be found here: `http://geoffair.org/fg/globe/`.

Cerberus examples:

- Original files from [three.js OBJ examples](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/models/obj/cerberus).
- Converted and modified to showcase multiple different `OBJ + MTL` loading options.
