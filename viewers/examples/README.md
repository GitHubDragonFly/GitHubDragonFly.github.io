The Lego Brick model was originally created as OBJ file by [JSModeler](https://github.com/kovacsv/JSModeler) and then modified and converted to other formats.

Legacy JSON examples are from r68 and r69 releases of the three.js and were modified as follows:

- adjusted positions of the root bone - all models
- changed `transparency` to `opacity` - marine / human_walk_0_female.js models
