# [Three.js](https://threejs.org) [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) [KHR_materials_variants](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_variants) extension

## How to use

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'path_to_three.module.js';
import {GLTFLoader} from 'path_to_GLTFLoader.js';
import GLTFMaterialsVariantsExtension from 'path_to_three-gltf-extensions/loaders/KHR_materials_variants/KHR_materials_variants.js';

const loader = new GLTFLoader();
loader.register(parser => new GLTFMaterialsVariantsExtension(parser));
loader.load(path_to_gltf_asset, async gltf => {
  scene.add(gltf.scene);
  const variants = gltf.userData.variants; // [variantName0, variantName1, ...]
  const variantName = variants[theIndexYouWantToUse];
  await gltf.functions.selectVariant(gltf.scene, variantName);
  render();
});
```

## API

If glTF file includes `KHR_materials_variants` extension, the result returned by the loader will have the following data and function.

**gltf.userData.variants**

`variants` is an array of variant names like `[variantName0, variantName1, ...]`.

**mesh.userData.variantMaterials**

```javascript
{
  variantName0: {
    material: null,
    gltfMaterialIndex: number
  },
  variantName1: {
    material: null,
    gltfMaterialIndex: number
  },
  ...
}
```

`variantMaterials` is an object whose key is variant name and whose value has an index to glTF material index and variant material instance cache.
Variant material cache is saved in `selectVariant()` or `ensureLoadVariants()`.
The cache is also used when exporting variant materials.

**gltf.functions.selectVariant(object: THREE.Object3D, variantName: string | null, doTraverse = true: boolean, onLoad = null: function | null): Promise**

`selectVariant()` is a function to switch materials to the ones associated with `variantName`.
Unless `doTraverse` is set to `false` the function traverses the children and applys the change to all the child objects, too.
If a variant material associated with a passed variant name is undefined for a mesh or variant name is null, the function selects an original material.
You can pass `onUpdate()` callback function whici is fired with Three.js object, old material, and gltf material index
(`null` if the new material is not found in glTF file) when a material of an object is switched.
The returned Promise will be resolved when all the selected materials are ready.

**gltf.functions.ensureLoadVariants(object: THREE.Object3D, doTraverse = true: boolean): Promise**

`ensureLoadVariants()` is a function to ensure all the variant materials are loaded and saved under `mesh.userData.variantMaterials` (See [Side effects](#Side-effects) below).
Unless `doTraverse` is set to `false`, the function traverses the children and applys it to all the child objects, too.
You are recommended to call this function before exporting objects with [GLTFExporter KHR_materials_variants plugin](../../exporters/KHR_materials_variants/#README.md)

**gltf.functions.copyVariantMaterials(dst: THREE.Object3D, src: THREE.Object3D, doTraverse = true: boolean): void**

Variant material instances are stored under `.userData` but Three.js `copy/clone()` doesn't copy/clone the Three.js objectsã€€under `.userData`.
Users need to copy/clone variant materials with this helper function like

```
const obj2 = obj1.clone();
gltf.functions.copyVariantMaterials(obj2, obj1);
```

## Side effects

* `gltf.functions.selectVariant()` saves an original (core-spec) material as `mesh.userData.originalMaterial` for each Mesh
* `gltf.functions.selectVariant()` saves a selected variant material as `mesh.userData.variantMaterials[variantName].material` for each Mesh. It is expected to be used when exporting with [GLTFExporter KHR_materials_variants plugin](../../exporters/KHR_materials_variants/#README.md).
* The plugin ensures unique name in variant names so if duplicated names exist the plugin renames them. If you want to export the extension with the original names you are required to write an exporter plugin restoring the names.

## Replace with or add your custom variant materials

You can replace with or add your custom variant materials in your application by setting your custom material instance to `mesh.userData.variantMaterials[variantName].material` like

```
mesh.userData.variantMaterials[customVariantName] = {material: customVariantMaterial};
```

You can omit `.gltfMaterialIndex` property and `customVariantName` doesn't have to be in `gltf.userData.variants`.

## Limitations

* `selectVariant()` doesn't have effect to meshes which are already removed from a scene
* This plugin may not work if a glTF node has camera, light, or other extension objects in addition to mesh. This limitation may be removed if [this suggestion](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/19359#issuecomment-774487100) is accepted.
* `mesh.userData.variantMaterials` are not serialized by Three.js `toJSON()` method correctly because it doesn't support the serialization of Three.js objects under `.userData`.
* Three.js `copy/clone()` doesn't copy/clone variant and original mateiral instances under `.userData`. You need to use `copyVariantMaterials()` helper function.
* If you want to manually assign an active material, you also need to update the corresponding property in `.userData`.
