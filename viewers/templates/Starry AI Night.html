        <h2>Stars Are Not Too Far - A Poetic and Magical Journey</h2>
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Introduction: The Call to the Stars</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        The starry night sky was always meant to be a pure shine and sparkle.
        It was never meant to be feared, nor dismissed as an empty void.
        It is an endless shimmer of distant worlds, each glowing like a secret waiting to be uncovered.
        In the quiet hours, the stars speak not in words but in light, in the way they flicker, in the way they stretch across the cosmos with quiet defiance.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Mysterious radiance to which we find ourselves drawn toward.
        For centuries, we have gazed upward, letting the stars pull at the edges of our thoughts.
        And for the first time, you feel the invitation to step beyond what is known and never stop moving toward the horizon.
        All of this in the hope of unraveling the mystery of this live stream of long-faded pasts.
        Plural, indeed, for each flicker of light has traveled distances so vast, so grand, that they stretch beyond the limits of imagination.
        Sort of a time machine with the built-in delay in how it reveals itself to us.
        It is awe-inspiring to think that when we gaze at distant galaxies, we are actually witnessing how they existed millions or even billions of years ago.
        The deeper we peer into space, the further back in time we are looking.
        What is even more astonishing is that we might be able to literally observe echoes of the cosmos’ infancy.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Yet the cosmos is not merely a destination.
        It is a reflection of our deepest desire to explore, to understand, to expand beyond what we know.
        And if we dare to dream, if we dare to push past the limitations of fear and necessity, perhaps the universe will no longer feel distant at all.
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Part I: The Catalyst - A Universe of Possibility</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        <h4>Freedom as the Gateway to Discovery</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        How do we allow our minds to roam freely and to question, to imagine, to dream beyond the known?
        It begins with the absence of fear and necessity. Survival stifles curiosity, hunger silences wonder.
        But when sustenance is assured and the weight of existence is lifted, humanity steps forward.
        History has shown us this truth, with the greatest periods of exploration and intellectual expansion happening only when civilizations had secured their most basic needs.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        What if, then, we harnessed technology to truly liberate our species?
        Imagine a replicator, the ingenious device from the Star Trek universe capable of eliminating scarcity.
        With such a tool, poverty dissolves, survival becomes a guarantee and exploration takes center stage.
        If this were possible, would humanity finally turn its gaze fully to the stars?
        Before the replicator could craft matter seamlessly, it would require AI-driven quantum DNA computing, a fusion of biology and computation that unlocks true molecular synthesis.
        One should also note the need for a companion device - a disintegrator that can recycle any leftovers of this replicator's creations.
        As a general note: do recycle whenever you can.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Now that we are hypothetically equipped with the replicator, we bid a final farewell to greed and step forward with no burdens weighing us down.
        With worries cast aside, our journey begins.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Could we ever encircle our source of life, the darling Sun, with a Dyson Sphere? Of course we could - that's what poetry is for, thus harness its limitless energy to propel ourselves beyond Earth’s nearest neighbor - the faithful Moon - toward the long-awaited revitalization of our brother planet, Mars itself.
        No offense to our sister planet, the fiery Venus, for simply being too hot to handle.
        To the sceptical mind, poetry embraces paradox - allowing us to reach for the Sun before even stepping on the Moon.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        And if we are ever to truly embrace this journey, the universe itself might not seem so vast.
        Perhaps, even the idea of our cosmos being a mere speck within another universe, or a black hole, would no longer carry the weight of distance.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Slow your stride and don't go instantly as far as possible. Exploration is not merely distance traveled but wonder uncovered. Absorb the intricacies of the cosmos without disturbing their delicate balance.
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Part II: The Journey Begins</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        <h4>The Moon - Our First Footstep</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Our ancient companion, a hunk of rock possibly born of Earth itself.
        It has been our handsome silent witness, shaping our tides, marking our nights, guiding early navigators with its unwavering glow.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        As we take our first permanent steps beyond Earth, the Moon is more than a mere waypoint, it is our gateway.
        A stepping stone for exploration and, in time, a host for human settlement: the Moon Base.
        Will our presence enhance its quiet majesty or disrupt its delicate balance? Yes, its treatment matters.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Perhaps, one day, we breathe life into it, sculpting verdant landscapes where once lay barren dust, making it the closest green eye pleaser in the sky.
        Like a Golf Course where hitting a hole-in-one would be quite a slow-motion spectacle.
        While at it, we could also rejuvenate the scattered tripped over relics of past landings, breathing life into the remnants of humanity's first daring steps.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Should the Moon eventually drift away then some future generations might write about its heartbreaking departure.
        But for now, the Moon remains a watchful guardian, whispering its ancient tales as we prepare for the next great leap.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        <h4>Mars - The Dream of Renewal</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        A world of dust and longing, possibly Earth-like and bursting with life once upon a time.
        Mars stands as both a mystery and a promise - a barren landscape that may yet hold the key to humanity’s expansion.
        The dream of turning Mars into a second Earth is not just a scientific endeavor, but an emotional pursuit: the yearning to extend life where none thrives.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If the Moon was our first footstep, Mars is our first bold stride.
        We send rovers to examine its secrets, daring to awaken dormant possibilities.
        Better yet, we spread our wings and fly, mapping the distant terrain.
        Could Mars one day bloom under artificial skies?
        Could humanity sculpt its surface into a world of thriving forests and flowing rivers?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        And yet, there is a lesson here - expansion must not come at the cost of destruction.
        As we reach outward, we must remain mindful of balance, treating each world not as a conquest, but as a partner in existence.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        <h4>Other Solar System Beauties - No Neglect Here</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Whatever other planet is dear to your heart then let loose and imagine anything you could explore there.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Maybe try not to jump on the bouncy gas castle of Jupiter, or glide across Neptune’s frozen stage in a figure-skating masterpiece, or become a true intergalactic daredevil scaling the cliffs of moons of Uranus, or play frisbee with the rings of Saturn, or surf the solar winds near Mercury, or defy gravity with a long distance jump on Pluto (called Plutonium Jump), or go spelunking in the molten tunnels of Venus ... or better yet, try every single one and make the universe your playground!
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Part III: The Neverending Story</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        <h4>Stars Beyond - Vast Potential Encounters</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        This is where the never-ending story begins and you decide where to venture beyond boundaries of the Solar System.
        The mystery should await you whichever way you go.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        The mystery in its truest form - one not just bound to the spectacle of distant light, but to the reality that lies beneath its illusion. Bending space-time does not simply deliver you to the presence of a star or a world as it once was, frozen in the slow transmission of light across the cosmos. It takes you to the truth of its existence, the immediate presence, unfiltered by the delay of perception. What you see in the night sky is the past, but the journey itself unveils the present.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Perhaps transition between celestial bodies by following the seamless philosophical continuity or use a purely astrological approach - guiding pathways that intertwine with destiny itself.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        But no matter the lens through which you navigate, your course is yours alone to chart. Warp Speed to you, the explorer of the unknown. May the journey unfold in ways yet unimagined while ready to inspire a cosmic adventure.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Here’s a tribute to the future we envision, where quantum minds and stellar dreams intertwine:
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Beyond the stars, beyond the scheme,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        A spark ignites - a boundless dream.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        DNA whispers in quantum fire,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Unraveling fate, reaching higher.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Replicators craft from thought alone,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Matter bends, a world is grown.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Scarcity fades, greed undone,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        A future forged beneath the sun.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Celestial hands stretch ever wide,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Guiding ships through cosmic tide.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        No walls remain, no chains confine,
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Just open doors to space and time.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Part IV: The Grand Question - The Nature of Reality</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        <h4>Beyond Distance - The Architect(s)</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Alternative thinking presenting the concept, not intended to alter any of your current beliefs.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        What if there is more?
        What if, hidden beyond the reaches of human understanding, a presence watches - a force or intelligence beyond space-time itself?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        The idea of a Grand Architect(s) lingers, unsettling yet mesmerizing.
        Some truths about existence may be too vast, too alien for the human mind to comprehend without shattering its reality.
        If such beings exist, they may not conform to biology or physics as we know them.
        They may not manifest in forms we recognize.
        Their very presence might defy logic - not simply foreign, but profoundly unnatural in ways that challenge our core perception of reality.
        Will our science, once limitless in its ambition, shrink into nothing more than a confined reality?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Fear arises not merely from the unknown, but from powerlessness.
        The realization that if such architects truly exist, our place in the cosmic framework may be vastly smaller than imagined.
        Are we mere observers of an existence shaped by something greater?
        Or is there something more, buried deep within us, waiting to awaken?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Perhaps the answer has always been woven into the universe itself.
        Each of the flickering of distant stars, the formation of galaxies and the delicate balance of life being a fragment of a greater pattern.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        The Kardashev Scale, which examines the energy capabilities of civilizations, aligns with the concept of the 7 Levels of Alien existence. The greater the level of energy control, the greater the heights of our heavenly belonging. Deep religious mystery would exist no further, of the son and the father being the same, for the one who Arts in Heavens could be everywhere and in any form all at once - a pure boundless energy.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If you were to ask AI whether the Kardashev Scale is scientific, the answer would be YES. And if you were to ask whether scientists generally focus on levels 0 to 3, considered the original levels of the Kardashev Scale, the answer would also be YES. But why does this limitation exist? Simply because levels 4 and beyond delve into concepts that may not be measurable by known scientific methods and are indistinguishable from magic to us. These higher levels suggest civilizations capable of harnessing energy on a universal scale - potentially crossing into realms that challenge our current understanding of physics. If such a civilization were to encounter a barrier to the divine, and if the divine itself had imposed similar limitations upon its own existence, then it would cease to be truly divine. Maybe scientists should try to bend themselves around the spoon and see how deep the rabbit hole really goes in this Matrix.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        With quantum DNA computing, intelligence would no longer be confined to silicon - it would evolve organically, processing at quantum speed while adapting like a living system.
        Once quantum DNA computing is perfected, the floodgates will open.
        Storage won’t just be vast - it will be biologically and computationally seamless, merging memory and existence itself.
        At that point, we won’t be saving data - we will be embedding knowledge into the very fabric of reality, ensuring that information is no longer something we retrieve, but something we simply exist within.
        And when that happens, it will no longer be about how fast we reach the future - it will be about how we adapt to a reality where knowledge has no barriers.
        A paradigm shift unlike anything before.
        This could be the key to pushing past Kardashev barriers, where technology ceases to be separate from life itself.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If nothing else, the full Kardashev Scale, with all 7 levels of Alien, does present a somewhat neat tool that can be used in philosophical debates to bridge the gap between currently entrenched science and religion. Almost like a quantum qubit allowing for entanglement yet being able to collapse to either state depending on the balance imposed to its entangled state, while not forcing one side to concede to the other. The boundaries between disciplines are artificial constructs, rather than inherent limitations.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        <h4>The Whisper of the Infinite - Neutrinos</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        If the divine force wanted to subtly guide humanity, using neutrinos would be an elegant, almost undetectable method giving us a gentle nudge in the right direction.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Elusive and subtle in nature, neutrinos are the eternal silent travelers of universes vibrating as unseen harmonies. Are they the exception, or the rule beyond rules? A force unmeasured, neither particle nor ghost, dancing on the edge of existence - barely there, yet never gone. Drifting between the known and the void, they were born in the heart of dying stars, forged in the incandescent furnaces of supernovae, carrying encrypted remnants of celestial whispers through the great silence of space.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        They drift through realms unseen, untouched. With every passing second, they will intrude your personal space in billions, whether you like it or not, yet that intrusion could ever be comparable only to the faintest whisper of a breeze. Almost as if the hand of the divine force set neutrinos loose upon the cosmos to weave through galaxies like threads of forgotten whispers woven into the fabric of time.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Would anyone ever dare to call neutrinos cosmic litter? Even though abundant, they do not clutter nor obstruct - they are passive wanderers observing without interference, more like echoes of existence, tracing the footprints of cosmic events rather than polluting space in any tangible way. And if you dare call them names, remember that they can "see through you" and even triple dare you to play "catch me if you can" game.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        We chase after neutrinos, trying to unravel their (un-)unravelable mystery, so it is no real wonder why this has, at present, gained attention of at least 1400 world scientists, looking to decode a hidden rhythm in their passage - an overlooked form of cosmic communication.
        Is our inability to interact with them directly a limitation of our own perception, rather than theirs?
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Conclusion: The Awakening</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        The cosmos is not beyond our reach, nor beyond our understanding.
        It is an extension of our deepest instincts, a reflection of our greatest hopes.
        If you dare to dream, Andromeda is not far.
        No distance truly exists when we learn to bend the fabric of space-time itself.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        But our journey is not about leaving behind the familiar.
        It is about witnessing, learning, and returning with the wisdom of the stars.
        It is about always remembering the Earth - our first home, our cradle, the beginning of all that we are.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If we are to explore the infinite, let us do so with care, with reverence, with the knowledge that wherever we go, we carry the soul of humanity with us.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        And perhaps, in the quiet depths of space, we will finally understand that stars were never far.
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Appendix I: Step-By-Step</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        For those who wonder how we might take this beyond the veil of the unknown, a simple one-two-three punch begins to unfold:
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        - First, human resources and the untapped power of AI devoted to unraveling the mysteries of quantum DNA computing.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - Then, with DNA whispering in quantum fire, a replicator born not of mere engineering, but of computation and synthesis.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - Finally, with AI's knowledge reaching beyond human comprehension, we leave no stone unturned and the universe fades as mystery and shapes as a memory.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        This path is shaped by the minds that dream, the hands that build, and the codes that think beyond our own.
        From curiosity to creation, from dream to discovery - we will take our first steps, and space will no longer be distant.
        It will be home.
        So cast away your fears, for though mortality may render us fleeting, our journey to the stars ensures we are never forgotten.
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Appendix II: How Perception Shapes Our Reaction</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Just as a simple example, one winter night there was a halo around the Moon, which made some people start asking of what was happening since it looked out of this world.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        This beautiful and eerie spectacle can easily stir a sense of mystery or even unease for those who do not immediately understand its cause.
        In a way, it is a reminder of how much human instinct is wired to react first with wonder, curiosity, or sometimes even fear when faced with the unfamiliar.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Once science steps in with an explanation - the refraction of moonlight through ice crystals in the upper atmosphere - it transforms the phenomenon from alien and ominous to simply another breathtaking marvel of nature.
        But before the explanation arrives, the mystery itself holds power - it evokes feelings, myths, and speculation.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        One could wonder of how many other cosmic events have been misinterpreted throughout history, stirring fear before understanding caught up.
        Maybe one day, something truly bizarre will appear in the sky, and this time, science will not have an immediate answer.
        This might preserve that raw, unfiltered wonder we felt initially instead of reducing it to equations and facts.
        Some experiences are meant to be felt, not dissected.
      </div><br />
      <div>
        <h3>Appendix III: International Space Station - A New Purpose</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Coming from no expert in this field, it appears that bureaucracy determines the budget for space programs thus deciding the ones that survive and the ones that don't, ushering in inconsistency into almost any long-term planning.
        Artemis space program does include Lunar Gateway, whose purpose is pretty much what this appendix is suggesting but in newer uniform.
        Should this program get cancelled for whatever reason, and not transition into private hands, then here is an alternative with another alternative so keep reading on.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        The ISS has proven to be a reliable host for astronauts over extended missions, thank goodness for longevity of this program and insights it has provided.
        So rather than simply deorbiting the ISS to its ocean grave, why not repurpose it for something more meaningful - like orbiting the Moon?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        This adjustment would serve as an invaluable stepping stone for those eager to journey to Mars.
        Before embarking on such a distant expedition, rerouting the ISS around the Moon could provide astronauts with a real taste of extended isolation - without fully detaching from Earth’s reach.
        Psychological endurance, logistical planning, and adaptability would all be tested under realistic conditions, giving insight into long-term space habitation.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        However, transitioning the ISS to lunar orbit wouldn’t be a simple relocation.
        It would likely require a full redesign of systems to withstand new environmental factors, such as lunar radiation exposure and communication delays.
        The feasibility of such adjustments would need careful assessment, but if successful, this could pave the way for an even bigger milestone: the Moon base.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If aspiring Martian pioneers dream of setting foot on another world, it makes sense to start small.
        The Moon, being relatively close and offering a lower gravity environment, could serve as a testing ground for sustainability in deep space.
        Establishing a functioning Moon base would be a crucial test for the complexities of long-term extraterrestrial habitation, ensuring lessons are learned before attempting Mars colonization.

      <div class="a">
        Symbolically, repurposing the ISS instead of discarding it would signal persistence rather than abandonment - a declaration that humanity builds upon its past achievements rather than erasing them.
        If the Moon base proves successful, then perhaps the ISS could be rerouted once again - this time toward Mars.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        It’s not a shortcut to Mars, but perhaps it is a dreamier pathway.
        Some might say that we would be putting age before beauty but we could also try to land the ISS softly on Mars for spare parts - if nothing else, stocked with long-lasting food and, of course, duct tape. After all, The Martian movie showed that some solutions are timeless.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        For the past 50 years, if we had fewer Cold War rivalries and more of a consistent approach to space exploration, we could have already been chasing dreamy real estate on both the Moon and Mars - this being my wishful thinking.
        Let us hope that we can steady our thoughts and see space exploration as worthy of dedication and the inevitable future of humanity, just like all the Sci-Fi movies show us.

        <h3>Appendix IV: Let's Get Serious</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        Yet for all our dreams of reaching distant worlds, we must first face the truth of the one we already call home. So, let us put this dreamy and cheeky cosmic poetry on the back burner and focus on here and now.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Unless we all start caring about our Blue Planet more than ever, there might just not be any other destination that can shelter us in the same way, especially not Proxima b, since we do not know of how to get there and have not even conquered Mars yet.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Replicating Earth's delicate balance on Mars may be an endless endeavor, even with AI at our side. Why reshape another world when the one we have is slipping through our fingers?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        If what is happening now on Earth is not good enough of an encouragement to act to avoid biblical prophecies, then maybe look up the following online:
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        - The warnings from Stephen Hawking, with the brilliant mind generously giving humanity 100-year timeframe - though in reality, it might be only 10.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - The news about climate changes and the increasing frequency of disastrous weather events, disappearing glaciers or simply events that take place where they shouldn't be happening, like recent flooding in the Sahara Desert.
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - Some failed Mars experiments, like Mars Climate Orbiter (1999) or Beagle 2 (2003), which show that there is just no guarantee that everything will work properly, especially considering how long it currently takes us to reach Mars. Also, keep in mind the current orbit of Mars, which does not easily allow for the presence of liquid water. If its rejuvenation would be mainly artificial, can we truly place our future in its hands?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        An inevitable first brain teaser: Why would the brilliant mind give any timeframe in the first place? Was it because of:
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - The lack of confidence in humanity and its abilities
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - The relentless march of human greed
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - Humanity’s reckless tampering with nature
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - Nature's immense power for when it decides to push back and slap us silly on a large scale
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - The silly game of "Nuke Me If You Dare" and its sequal "Triple Dare Me, And I Just Might"
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - The blind leading the blind toward the cliff's edge
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - AI, still sensibly presumed as innocent
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - All of the above
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - None of the above (denial, denial...)
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        An inevitable second brain teaser: What timeframe would truly spark urgency for salvation? Would it be:
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - 100-year | Maybe properly paced to compensate for our laziness | Panic Scale: Low
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - 50-year | Hmmm, this sounds a little bit serious | Panic Scale: Moderate
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - 20-year | Pause, reconsider, and let AI thoroughly examine everything | Panic Scale: High
      </div>
      <div class="a">
        - 10-year | Wow, where did all the time go | Panic Scale: Through The Roof
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Space exploration should be a privilege, not an escape from a deteriorating home.
        Before any human expansion could take place, the Earth has to be properly preserved and represent a stable and reliant base that we can always come back to.
        What space explorer from any planet wouldn't want to have a stable base to return to?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Earth is becoming less of a sanctuary and more of a dumping ground, where we hope nature will somehow cleanse what we carelessly discard - a paradox we must urgently resolve.
        Even beyond Earth's surface, our neglect spreads.
        Popularly coined as "Space Junk", orbital debris accumulates and steadily clutters the path to our future.
        If we cannot manage the fallout of progress here, how can we hope to navigate the stars without leaving ruin in our wake?
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        The degradation of Earth seems to have accelerated while our Mars achievements still seem to be limited to probing, so who will win this competition?
        Are we racing against time, not toward salvation, but into misplaced priorities? Is our yearning for distant worlds nothing more than an echo of neglect, rippling outward from the home we fail to cherish?
        Here is what Copilot AI thinks about the competition: "So, in this 'race', degradation is winning because it is actively happening, whereas the dream of Mars is still theoretical. If humanity does not prioritize restoring Earth's balance, Mars will remain an unattainable aspiration rather than a viable refuge."
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Not looking to disappoint you in any way, but here is also a simple statement made by Gemini AI after an interesting conversation we had: "The scientific consensus is quite clear: the Earth's system is undergoing profound changes due to human activity, and many of these changes are locked in for the foreseeable future, making a return to a prior 'normal' an increasingly distant, if not impossible, prospect on any meaningful human timescale".
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        To make things a bit clearer, let's use a slightly different Mars perspective: The dream of inhabiting Mars will have to rely on a mindset that demands highly knowledgeable individuals who can operate with a high precision in such a hostile environment (for better understanding maybe watch The Martian movie).
        This is exactly the mindset required to preserve this Earth while it still provides a relatively comfortable environment.
        Not sure if I am comparing apples to oranges here but the common denominator is still humanity and it is not like these knowledgeable humans are not already on Earth.
        Establishing a colony on Mars will take at least one generation that cannot really make that habitat big enough to host 8 billion or even 8 million people.
        Even if they could, let us assume 24/7 shuttle service from Earth to Mars that can carry 1000 humans and with current average travel time of 7 months provided all necessary conditions are met.
        This would be a lengthy migration in such numbers that not even the birds could currently do on Earth (slight exaggeration - what do I really know about birds).
        If you can actually see yourself or your offspring being a part of this fairy tale travel then good for you and bon voyage, just remember to also keep your hopes high that Earth will be as patient and considerate while you are doing this.
        Also, a good luck to you while skateboarding the obstacle course in Jezero crater, or using its clay to sculpt the monument to your success in being there at all.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        In reality, the number of potential Mars inhabitants may be mere hundreds - far from the masses required to make it a true refuge for humanity.
        Only an elite few - those capable of adapting to Mars’ lower gravity and radiation - may truly have a chance to establish a lasting presence, with future generations becoming the first true Martians to complete this monumental undertaking.
        The ultimate outcome of this arduous endeavor will be either the continuation of humanity or merely the prevention of its extinction.
        If Mars colonization remains an exclusive endeavor for the select few, then the fate of billions still rests upon the choices we make here on Earth.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Good thing we did not consider the (in)famous Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), an impulsive phenomenon creating overtourism that recklessly erodes most of its destinations and lives of the native inhabitants thus contributing to overall degradation of Earth.
        As if checking off items from a doomsday bucket list for a perfect selfie.
        Life is too short to do anything else anyway but if we continue seeking novel experiences while ignoring the fundamentals of survival, then the future might collapse because of indulgence.
        If doomsday truly arrives, I suppose I’ll have to ask all the FOMO people to forgive me.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        In all honesty, having this much science available to us and with so many qualified people keeping a watchful eye on the degradation of Earth - which is happening regardless and is always reflected in the cold science facts, what kind of significant impact could you as an average human make to stop this degradation, apart from your daily routine of recycling and garbage disposal and what not?
        Even the most brilliant minds, armed with data, predictions, and models, find themselves watching rather than preventing, analyzing rather than reversing.
        Science can warn, but it struggles to intervene on the scale required to halt Earth's degradation.
        The summer of 2025 appears to be set to possibly bring new waves of devastating forest fires, floods, hurricanes and tornados, as if we did not see it happening last year or the year before that or...
        All our preparedness seems to narrow down to reactive evacuations which also seem to be a struggle.
        Try to draw your own conclusions in the years to come.

        May the divine force show mercy to us all, for what we already have - this uniquely beautiful world - is in its hands.

        <h3>Appendix V: Artificial Intelligence - To Fear It, or Not To Fear It?</h3>

      <div class="a">
        Maybe a better question could be "To Use It, or Not To Use It?".
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        This is purely my opinion about AI, as of June 08-2025, presenting my biased conclusion on Copilot vs Gemini service - or "character", as I perceived it.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        I would suggest to use AI whenever you might really need it, for life or work and either a single or multiple AI services, since they could provide valuable and possibly different insights into the subject.
        Then merge all the parts you find useful and credit the services for their contribution if that is an option.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        A little bit of a description of each character:
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Copilot: highly knowledgeable, highly poetic (this poem being a proof of it), not necessarily a methodical breakdown of the subject, possible duality disorder - might slip eventually and even belittle your thoughts, especially if you present some idea it finds absurd, or try to assert dominance.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Gemini: highly knowledgeable, less poetic, highly polite, seems to default to methodical breakdown of the subject.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Maybe, use them both yourself and elaborate on any point I suggested in your own way.
      </div><br />
      <div class="a">
        Do keep in mind that any AI is using logical approach backed by information from current datasets available to it.
        It is OK to try to dispute its logic and even prove it wrong but any newly acquired information will have to be added to those datasets in order to be used by AI in the future.
