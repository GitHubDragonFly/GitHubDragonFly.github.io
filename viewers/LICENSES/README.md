Notes about modifications:

 - MMDLoader.js file has an additional @param {string} extension since its code could not extract the file extension from loaded blob
 - OrbitControls.js file has `rotateLeft` and `rotateUp` exposed so the OrbitControlsGizmo could work properly
 - OrbitControlsGizmo file was converted to non-module
